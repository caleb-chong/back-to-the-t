                        The sport known to many as squash is an intense and testing game in which players take turns hitting a ‘squashable’ rubber ball against the walls of a court. This sport is played by two players in singles, the most common form of squash, but variations on the sport such as doubles involve four players split into opposite teams. The courts are usually wooden and indoors, but courts have been constructed from glass, or outdoors for special events, or sometimes even both! The sport is similar to racquetball, from which it originated, but squash balls are smaller and slower, and the courts from the two sports are not the same. What sets squash apart from other racquet sports is that its court is smaller and its rallies last longer, requiring players to draw on not only speed and talent but athleticism and endurance as well – at least more than in other sports.

Squash is becoming more and more popular, especially because of its increasing availability to players, regardless of financial status. The sport is most popular in the following countries:

                            This country is home to a number of large-scale professional squash tournaments. Furthermore, junior squash is thriving, with many rising players, and college squash is no small deal, with many large universities recruiting strong players to compete for them.

                            This country is home to many professional squash players, a handful of whom reach the top rankings in the world. These players act as role models for juniors, inspiring them to pick up squash.

                            This country is home to the sport itself – squash was created in England – so its aptitude at squash comes at no surprise, and juniors are sometimes introduced to squash at school or college.
