                        The courts in squash seem complex but are in fact quite simple to understand. There are four walls: the front wall, two side walls, and the back wall. There are lines crossing from left to right on each of the walls – the topmost line on each wall demonstrates ‘out’ zone, and if a shot hits the wall above one of these lines, it is considered out of play. Then, on the front wall there are two more lines: the service line and the tin. The service line is a horizontal line, and players serving must serve their shot above this line. Then, the tin is a small metal strip (about one to two feet in height) at the bottom of the front wall, and any shot that comes into contact with the tin is considered out. The tin makes a metallic noise when it is hit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ground of a squash court is more complex. There are two square boxes on either side of the court, and players must serve with at least one foot inside the box on their side. Then, there is a horizontal line connecting the tops of the boxes, called the service line as well – serves must land past this line. The last line on the ground is a vertical line connecting the back of the court to the service line, and this divides the rear of the court into two, creating zones on each side into which players must serve. The intersection of this vertical line and the service line is known as the ‘T,’ and it is common strategy for players to return to this spot after playing a shot as it is near the center of the court, giving them equal access to the next shot, wherever it may be.

                What is the Objective of Squash?

                        The game of squash involves two players taking turns to hit the squash ball against the walls of the court. The way each shot works is that each shot must at some point hit the front wall before reaching the floor. The side walls and back wall are supplementary: players can use them to their advantage to make it harder to reach the ball or deceive an opponent, but they are by no means mandatory to use. The objective of squash, therefore, is to hit a shot that the opponent cannot get, either because the opponent cannot reach it before it bounces twice or because the opponent makes an error and does not hit it into play. There are other ways players can earn points, through conduct calls, but conduct calls occur only when there is interference with typical gameplay. When a player has won a rally (a series of shots within gameplay) in this way, they earn a point. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rallies in squash begin with a serve. The player serving must place one foot inside the service box on their side, then hit their shot above the service line on the front wall and have it land behind the service line on the floor yet on the opposite side of the court (as shown by the vertical line at the court’s rear). Then the two players alternate shots until the rally is over. If the player who served won the point, they must then proceed to serve again, but from the other side. If the player who received the serve won the point, they serve, and they may choose which side they serve from. This process then repeats.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most common way squash is scored is in games of eleven. Thus, two players might play until one of them has won three games to eleven (this is how most tournaments work scoring) but players may choose to count score another way.

                Rules and Conduct Calls
            </h2>
            <div id="conductSection">
                <p>
                    There are three types of conduct calls that can be made in squash: let, stroke and no let. The referee (there is usually one referee) makes the call, but if there is no referee (in cases of casual play) then the players make the call themselves. To receive a conduct call, players must appeal to the referee after certain situations in the game.
                </p>
                <br>
                <iframe width="80%" height="72%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnE-cRK-4jA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="conductVideo"></iframe>
                <p>
                    The call of stroke is given when one player prevents the other player’s shot from reaching its intended target: the front wall. This can happen if one player gets in the way of the other person’s swing, or if one player hits the other player with a shot, but players can appeal for a stroke before the shot actually happens to avoid this collateral damage and sometimes injury. If a player plays a shot and incurs this 'damage' during a match, the referee may provide them with a warning to appeal for a call instead of going through with their shot. If the shot would not have reached the front wall, even with no obstruction, a no let is given. If a stroke is awarded, the recipient wins the point.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The call of let is given when one player prevents the other player from reaching the ball to play their next shot. This is mostly unintentional. This can happen if players bump into each other, or if one accidentally trips the other, or more. If the conditions for a stroke are met but giving a stroke seems preposterous or over the top, since the chances of one player hitting the other would have been low, then referees may choose to award a let as well. If a let is awarded, the players re-do the point and play it again.
                </p>
                <br>
                <iframe width="80%" height="72%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/elCUzGH0XAg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="conductVideo"></iframe>
                <p>
                    The last call is no let, and this is when no call should be given. This occurs when the player could have reached the ball and had full, unobstructed access. The problem with lets and strokes is that players may choose to create a situation where their access to the ball is limited, such as one in which they intentionally bump into the other player or make it look like they would have hit the other player. The correct call to give here would be a no let. If a player cannot reach the ball because they took an unconventional route as well and the other player did not interfere, the call might sometimes be no let as well. If a no let is awarded, the recipient forfeits the point to their opponent.
